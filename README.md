## What is Gosane?

Gosane is a cloneable API template to get you up and running quickly. It has made a lot of decisions for you, but easily allows you to swap out the things you don't like.

## Structure

Gosane is structured as follows:

### Handlers

Each handler (or endpoint) is grouped and encapsulated in its own folder as can be seen [here](/api/handler/user). Firstly, you must define the relative path for the handler group in a file such as [this](/api/handler/user/user.go), and then define each endpoint as a separate handler.

### Services & Stores

A handler interacts with your business logic through services, which are aptly defined in `/service`. These services interact with your database entities (through ent) via stores. The flow of information should look something like the following:

Handler <-> Services <-> Stores

A store should never be used directly in a handler.

## How to use Gosane

### 1. Clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sno6/gosane.git
```

### 2. Run the damn thing

```sh
./run.sh
```

> Note that if the above command errors you may need to give the script executive permissions by running: `chmod +x ./run.sh`
