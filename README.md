## What is Gosane?

Gosane is a cloneable API template to get you up and running quickly. It has made a lot of decisions for you, but easily allows you to swap out the things you don't like.

## How to use Gosane

### 1. Clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sno6/gosane.git
```

### 2. Run the damn thing

```sh
./run.sh
```

> Note that if the above command errors you may need to give the script executive permissions by running: `chmod +x ./run.sh`
