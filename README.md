## What is Gosane?

Gosane is a cloneable API template to get you up and running quickly. It has made a lot of decisions for you, but easily allows you to swap out the things you don't like.

## Features

| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Auth üîë | Social (FB / Google) as well as email based JWT authentication. |
| Database üíΩ | Database support using the amazing https://github.com/ent/ent package. |
| Email ‚úâÔ∏è | There's an example AWS SES implementation and an easily extendable interface. |
| Config üóÉ | Simple JSON and environment based configuration. |
| Monitoring üïµÔ∏è | Prometheus handlers for monitoring. |
| Errors üî¶ | Automatic sentry error logging via: https://sentry.io |
| Validation üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Validation using an extended version of the https://github.com/go-playground/validator package. |
| Build / Test üí™ | Automatically build and test your code with built in Github pipelines. |
| Server | The underlying server framework is Gin, so you benefit from all the goodness you can find over at: https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin |

## Structure

> Browse the codebase in VS Code here: https://github1s.com/sno6/gosane

Gosane is structured as follows:

### Handlers

Each handler (or endpoint) is grouped and encapsulated in its own folder as can be seen [here](/api/handler). Firstly, you must define the relative path for the handler group in a file such as [this](/api/handler/user/user.go), and then define each endpoint as a separate handler.

### Services & Stores

A handler interacts with your business logic through services, which are aptly defined in [`/service`](/service). These services interact with your database entities (using ent) via [stores](/store). The flow of information should look something like the following:

Handler <-> Services <-> Stores

A store should never be used directly in a handler, and a service should never be used in a store.

### Internal

Anything that isn't considered business logic should live here. Typically you want to structure these as small modules that you could rip out and run isolated from the rest of the project, if you had to. Examples include, [email](/internal/email), [database](/internal/database), [sentry (error management)](/internal/sentry), etc.

### Dependencies

Gosane follows a simple dependency injection plan. All dependencies for your API are defined in [`api/register.go`](/api/register.go). The [server](/internal/server/server.go) initialises all dependencies and passes them through to the handlers via the Register method.

### That's about it, the rest is up to you.

## How to use Gosane

### 1. Clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sno6/gosane.git
```

### 2. Run the damn thing

```sh
./run.sh
```

> Note that if the above command errors you may need to give the script executive permissions by running: `chmod +x ./run.sh`

## Potential issues

### But what if I don't want social OAuth?

Just simply rip out everything for social OAuth. Here's where everything will be:

1. `/api/handler/oauth`  This whole folder can go.
2. `/api/register.go`    Remove the reference to the OAuth handler here.
3. `/config/config.go`   Remove everything to do with OAuth from the config.
4. `/internal/server.go` Remove the fb/google configs that are passed to the API as dependencies.

### But what if I don't want Sentry?

Similarly, do the following:

1. `/internal/sentry`    This whole folder can go.
2. `/config/config.go`   Remove all Sentry related config params.
3. `/api/register.go`    Remove the reference to Sentry from the dependencies list here.
4. `/internal/server.go` Remove the Sentry dependency and deferred handler from here.
